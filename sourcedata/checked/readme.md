# Checked Source Data

### Instructions
This folder contains the data that has been checked and confirmed to be in order.


### Project Notes
- Included and excluded files were manually moved to their respective folders, based on the notes from the "PRE_dataset_organization.xlsx" in the "exclusion" and "exclusion-reason" columns.
- The main reason for file exclusion was they were actually the parent flanker file misnamed as the children's flanker. There are a handful of other reasons, but these reasons are not based on analyses (e.g. low accuracy).
